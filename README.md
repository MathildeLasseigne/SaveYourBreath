### How to run
1. install dependencies then start the server (Express):
```shell
cd server
npm install
npm start # if you don't want nodemon to automatically restart your server on code changes, you can run "node index.js" instead
```
2. open another terminal and install dependencies then start the client (React):
``` shell
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

If using Github Codespaces, remember to set the port of the server to public (Ports > Right-click 8080 > Port Visibility > Public)
